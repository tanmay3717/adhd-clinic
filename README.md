The front end and the back end are in the same repositories. The /frontend directory contains the React app with Typescript, and /backend directory contains the NodeJS application with Typescript.


## Prerequisites

In the /backend directory, create a new file called .env.local 
Set the variable as MONGODB_URL={url provided by me}
This is an important step otherwise the database won't be connected to the application.

## Run the application
To run the server, just navigate to the /backend directory and in the terminal use 
`yarn start-server` or `npm start-server`

Open a new terminal To run the React app, and navigate to the /frontend directory. Use `yarn start-browser` or `npm-start-browser`
to start the React browser.

The form is ready to be used! 

Thank you!
